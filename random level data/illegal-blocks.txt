Illegal color (static node):
Change r, g, and b to anything. I tried changing a, but it didnt change opacity.

Any crumbling block (crumbling node):
change material to any other material. DEFAULT_COLORED only works without a color attribute.

Super fast crumble time (crumbling node):
change stableTime to a decimal below 0.5. I have found that below 0.001 wont work.

No crumbling time and super slow crumble time (crumbling and static nodes):
change stableTime to a decimal above 60 for extra long times, or use GRABBABLE_CRUMBLING as the material in a static node for infinite stable time.

Fast or slow respawn time (crumbling node):
change respawnTime to an illegal value.

Multiple starts and multiple finishes (start and finish nodes):
Have multiple nodes of each type.

Illegal start and finish radius (start and finish nodes):
Change radius to any number. radius will reset if you select an illegal node.

Perma-locking objects (not node related):
if you select things in someones lobby and you get locked, kicked, or leave the selection becomes unselectable for others.
